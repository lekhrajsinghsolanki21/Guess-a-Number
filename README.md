# Guess a Number

A simple command-line game where the computer randomly selects a number, and the player tries to guess it.

## How to Play

1. The computer thinks of a random number within a specified range (e.g., 1 to 100).
2. The player types a guess.
3. The computer responds whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.
4. Repeat until the player guesses the correct number.

## Example

```
Guess a number between 1 and 100:
> 50
Too low!
> 75
Too high!
> 63
Correct! You guessed the number in 3 tries.
```

## Features

- Input validation.
- Feedback for each guess.
- Tracks the number of attempts.

## Requirements

- Python 3 (or adapt to another language as needed)

python guess_a_number.py
```
